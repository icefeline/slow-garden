/**
 * How the module fills in.
 *
 * The log prints a line at a time rather than the whole block landing at once,
 * so the wait reads as the machine working through it: the command, then the
 * thinking, then what it found in the chart, then the read. A terminal echoing
 * its own progress, not decoration — which is what keeps it on the right side
 * of the spec's "nothing animates".
 *
 * The two waiting lines are held by the fetch, not by a stopwatch: `thinking`
 * only decides when the first swaps to the second, and whichever is showing
 * stays until the answer is actually back. An earlier version expired them on a
 * fixed timer and left the block empty for as long as the request took.
 *
 * `body` is the one deliberate pause — the read is held a beat after the
 * transit line so the two don't arrive together and lose the sense of one
 * following from the other.
 *
 * `pattern` holds the stamp row back a further beat past the body, so it
 * reads as something the machine noticed after finishing the read, not as
 * one more paragraph landing in the same breath.
